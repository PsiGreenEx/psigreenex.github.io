        <h1>Inflated Numbers in Video Games</h1>

        <p>
            One thing that bugs me so much in video games (namely RPGs) are inflated numbers. When you're near the beginning of the game and you are already doing damage well into the hundreds. That kind of thing really lessens the weight of those numbers. Not only that, but humans aren't very good at comparing large numbers, meaning that it can be harder to tell how much better, say, one piece of armor is over another, or how much stronger one enemy is over another.
        </p>
        <h2>Why games have them</h2>
        <p>I'd argue there are two main reasons a game would have inflated numbers.</p>
        <h3>1. Granularity</h3>
        <p>
            Having large numbers in your game means that you can make smaller stat differences without dipping into decimal places too hard. This makes sense to me because I think that "13892 damage" looks prettier than "138.92 damage". An example of this is Runescape. In a game update, they decided to multipy all hitpoints by 10, instead of displaying a rounded integer.<sup><a href="./inflated-numbers-in-games.html#ref1">[1]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <h3>2. A Vestige of Old Arcade Games</h3>
        <p>
            Old arcade games would usually include huge numbers for their scores, because, monke brain like big number. Seeing your 1,583,000 score sitting on a leaderboard is much more satisfying then seeing the number that is likely actually stored in memory, 1,583. This idea of big numbers being really satisfying is the idea most idle games are based on. We're this gets bad is when this idea is applied to currencies of games in genres like RPGs. At a certain point the money starts to become worth extremely little and players are having to spend 2 trillion gold to buy the next piece of armor.
        </p>
        <h2>My issue with them</h2>
        <p>
            My main argument against them is this: When you inflate the numbers of a game, you lessen the effect of increasing that number. When you have enemies with 10 health and you do 2 damage per hit, it makes the player appreciate each point of damage more. And when you finally get near the end game, that 900,000 damage you deal feels a lot more satisfying.
